# TYPO3 Extension ``pb_notifications`` 


## Description

This extension manages notifications for editors in the backend.


## Introduction

### What does it do?

This extension manages notifications for editors in the backend.

* You can create two types of notifications (information / warning).
* Select the backend user groups, which should see this notification (leave empty for all users)
* Add up to 3 images to your notification to illustrate the information
* Configure (extension configuration), if a popup will be shown after the user logs into the backend, if he has unread notifications

The editors get a list of notifications in the TYPO3 backend.
If there are new, unread notifications, they will see a coloured icon according to that in the top-bar inside the TYPO3 backend.
